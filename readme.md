## Project Title
**NFT Charity Auction**

## Project Description
The NFT Charity Auction is a platform that allows users to auction NFTs for charitable causes. The goal of this platform is to bridge the world of NFTs with philanthropy, enabling artists, collectors, and investors to contribute to charity while participating in the growing NFT market. The platform ensures that the proceeds from auctions are directed toward verified charity organizations.

The smart contract facilitates the creation of auctions, placing bids, and ensuring that the funds from the winning bid are transferred to the designated charity. This creates a seamless and transparent way to raise funds for important causes.

## Project Vision
The vision for NFT Charity Auction is to merge the exciting world of digital art and NFTs with impactful charity work. By creating an auction platform for NFTs where the proceeds go directly to charitable causes, we aim to:
- Support artists and creators by giving them a platform to auction their work.
- Empower buyers to support their favorite causes while collecting unique NFTs.
- Bring more attention to charity-driven NFT initiatives and expand their reach.
- Ensure transparency in the donation process, making it easy for donors to see their contributions making a difference.

## Future Scope
While this initial version focuses on the auction and bid functionality, future enhancements could include:
- Integration with multiple charity organizations, enabling users to choose their preferred charity.
- NFT verification and provenance tracking to ensure authenticity.
- The ability to accept various tokens, including cryptocurrencies beyond Aptos Coin.
- Community governance features, where users can vote on new charity organizations to include in the platform.
- Special events and auctions involving well-known artists and influencers to raise awareness and engagement.
- A marketplace for NFT trading where users can buy, sell, and auction NFTs with charity donations as a feature.

## Key Features
- **NFT Auction Creation**: Users can create NFT auctions and set a charity address where the auction proceeds will be sent.
- **Bid Placement**: Users can place bids on NFTs, ensuring that the highest bid wins the auction.
- **Charity Fund Allocation**: All auction proceeds are transferred directly to the designated charity address.
- **Transparent Fund Flow**: All transactions related to the auction, including bids and donations, are logged on the blockchain, ensuring transparency.
- **Refunding Previous Bidders**: In the event a new highest bid is placed, the previous highest bidder is refunded, maintaining fairness in the bidding process.
